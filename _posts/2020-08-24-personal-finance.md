I've been reading some personal finance books lately. I enjoy thinking about personal finance, but I really don't like the personal finance industry. If you're like me, here are some books you might find tolerable.

One book that I re-read about once a year is *The Index Card* by Helaine Olen and Harold Pollack. The premise is that financial advice for most people is so straightforward that it could fit on an index card (hence the title). It's based on a picture of such an index card created by Pollack that went viral a few years ago. Each point is expanded upon in the book, which is nice, but the index card itself is all you really need. I like this book because it's  short and approachable and reading it doesn't make me feel like a moron.

The book I'm reading now is *I Will Teach You To Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi. Sethi has a different style from Olen and Pollack, which is very Tech Bro, but once you cut through that, his overall advice is similar to theirs. I'm finding it's a nice supplement to *The Index Card* because Sethi gives a lot more practical advice geared towards Millennials like me, like scripts for emails and phone calls.

These two books got me thinking about what my personal index card would say (see below), which I think ended up as a blend of both books.

I didn't write this in order to give advice. (This is why I tried to avoid Dos and Don'ts, because I'm not a professional and I don't know what I'm talking about.) It was more of a personal exercise for me to uncover what my own financial intuitions are.

These points may be most relatable to people who have consistent incomes and who make more money than they need to spend. For a while in my adult life, this was not me. But I kept these things in mind as my income increased.

Here's what I came up with:

1. The amount of money you save is less important than making your savings automatic

2. Separate your savings account from your spending account

3. A high-yield savings account is better than not a high-yield savings account. Pick any high-yield savings account, the exact one isn't important.

4. Treat credit card money like cash on hand

5. Budgets that aren't realistic won't be followed

6. Max out Roth options and company matches as much as possible

7. Negotiate for higher pay. Switching jobs is the best time to do this, but if that's not the case, do it anyway.

8. Keep a number of months worth of living expenses as cash on hand. Use this to leave jobs you hate. (Suze Orman calls this a "Fuck-off" fund)

9. Be conscious of lifestyle creep and subscription creep (easier said than done, I know)

10. Take the time to figure out the things you truly care about. Optimize your saving and spending for those things.

11. If you do this, then worrying about the price of lattes or avocado toasts isn't worth it.

What would your index card be? Let me know!
