Something that comes up a lot when I talk with other developers is the difficulty of coding and/or learning in our spare time.

Thinking about how much I should be doing outside of work to grow my skills can be a source of stress and anxiety. People feel guilty about not having a side project, not taking that online course, or not contributing to open source projects.

I especially hear this from developers with a similar background to mine (bootcamp grads). It personally took me a good two years of coding professionally before I felt like I had enough mental energy outside of working hours to do these things. Going right from a bootcamp into working full-time, each day I felt like I was in learning overdrive, and coding outside of work for any significant amount of time often depleted my energy and enthusiasm. It just didn’t feel like a healthy thing to be doing.

It took me a while to recognize the learning activities that actually gave me energy. For me, it’s mostly blogging, watching live coding videos, discovering ways to improve my processes and environment, and chatting with other developers.

It’s still not straight coding as often as I would like it to be, but I’m slowly getting there.

A few things have helped me code more in my spare time. One is to pick activities that are different enough from what I do every day at work. Otherwise I just get burned out. I enjoy scripting and am curious about working with larger data sets, but as a mostly front-end developer, I don’t get the opportunity to dive into this stuff as often as I would like. For this reason I enjoy doing Project Euler problems in my spare time, which are meaty but self-contained enough to do in one sitting.

As a junior developer, a lot of spare time is spent leveling up on particular skills needed for your job. I have more success when I approach these tasks with an attitude that’s not, “ugh I gotta do this work thing,” but rather, “hey this is an intriguing concept that’s important to my chosen profession.” Approaching tasks from a place of curiosity rather than obligation is a subtle change in attitude that can have a big impact on motivation.

I mention blogging as one of my growth activities, because technical blogging does a lot of productive things that directly relate to my coding. First, it gives me the opportunity to critically reflect on what I’ve worked on. Some of my best refactoring moments have happened because I was writing a post about some task, and suddenly thought of a better way to do it. It also challenges my assumptions and forces me to put what I think I know into words. I usually have a bunch of documentation tabs open as I write a post to look up the correct term for something, to clarify a concept, or to peer into the source code for a tool I’m writing about. If you don’t think technical writing is for you, I would encourage you to try it for these reasons alone.

There are the days when actively creating something just ain’t gonna happen. These days are good for watching videos. Videos I’ve enjoyed are from Upcase by thoughtbot, Destroy All Software by Gary Bernhardt, and Rally Coding by Stephen Grider. Most of these cost money, but even if you can’t get your workplace to subsidize that cost, I still consider it a worthwhile investment.

One trick I impose on myself is to only commit (at first) to fifteen minutes of work. If I tell myself, “just do this thing for fifteen minutes,” I’m much more likely to start it. That’s enough time for me to get invested, and that fifteen minutes can turn in to a few hours. This is the same I trick I use to go to the gym. Once I’m on that treadmill, I’m good. It’s getting there that’s the biggest hurdle.

I want to be a balanced, well-rounded person. I also want to be honest about the fact that this profession requires a commitment to learning and self-growth, and there will be times when I just need to put my head down and level up. I could write a whole other post about the politics and complexities of balancing these goals as one begins a programming career. But if I’ve had one major takeaway, it’s that being able to get “little” things done, like watching a video or a solving a Project Euler problem, is better than that big passion project that overwhelms you so much, you never start it. Little things do add up.
