Like for white boys and Led Zeppelin, every nerdy white girl goes through a Joan Didion phase. I've been trying to make a dent in the unread books already on my shelves, and one of them was Didion's *The White Album*. I had read *Slouching Towards Bethlehem* right after college and *The Year of Magical Thinking* right after that, and then bought *The White Album* thinking I would continue my streak. But it stayed on my shelf  unread.

I kept it around, confident that I was saving it for when I would need to read something I knew I'd enjoy. I picked it up now thinking Didion's commentary on the '60's could give me some way to make sense of our current times. It did not make me make sense of our current times. In fact, it made me feel worse. I had waited too long.

It's probably good that her elitism doesn't appeal to me anymore. But I rarely remember the content of a Didion essay. What I remember more is the tone, the visceral effect it has on me. Her writing is ambient and meditative. When I read it I'm in a trance, even if I don't agree with what she's saying.

There was a time when I wanted to write just like Joan Didion. This coincided with a time when I cared a lot about being cool. I don't care much about being cool anymore, so I don't get the same effect from her writing that I used to. But I'm on nodding terms with it.
