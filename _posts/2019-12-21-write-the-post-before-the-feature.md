I recently finished Ryan Singer’s book [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup){:target="_blank"}, which describes BaseCamp’s style of “shaping” product work before, during, and after engineering work happens. I’d recommend this book to anyone involved in product decisions — it’s concise, easy to read, and it gave me language for a lot of common situations I find myself in.

Reading *Shape Up* got me thinking about my own strategies for shaping work. My profession isn’t product ownership or user experience design, but as a software engineer at a small startup, having these skills helps a lot.

Being small, our engineering team has lots of responsibilities around product strategy and design. In some ways, this makes us efficient. We can identify, plan, and implement new features with a speed most companies can only dream of.

But in other ways, our deep knowledge of the product hinders us when we need to “think like a user.”
Being an effective engineer requires me to be very familiar with the internals of our product. But as such, I need periodic reality checks that what’s familiar to me probably isn’t going to be familiar to a customer.

Stepping out of the environment I’m immersed in every day is hard. Instead of trying to freely imagine what a customer might want, I’ve found that I need ways to force myself into a customer’s frame of mind.

Writing blog posts about a new feature — before I build the feature — has been a great way to do this for me. Since our company announces new features through blog posts (which our team drafts), writing posts beforehand can serve the dual purpose of shaping our work and communicating it to others.

### Writing gives common terms for everyone

Engineers tend to use their own engineer-y terms for things. (For example, what we call “orders” to our customers, we call “requisitions” in our code base.) Writing a blog post forces you to define terms that customers can understand, and gives a common vocabulary for everyone involved in product decisions, whether or not they touch the code.

### Writing clarifies the problem and solution

In some ways, writing Kanban cards in the “As a user I want to X so I can Y” style is getting at a similar thing. Writing cards this way is helpful, as it keeps the reason for your task top-of-mind. But this framing work should be done before you start writing cards.

Writing a blog post where the customer (and not the developer) is the audience holds you accountable to the user stories you’ll eventually write.

This exercise often helps us see where features can be broken down into smaller tasks. Are we trying to tackle too much with this feature?

We can also discover if our problem is clearly defined to begin with. If it’s not, then we may need to revisit the feedback we’ve been getting from users, talk to more users to better understand the problem, or set this task aside in favor of more pressing issues.

### How we write blog posts

These posts shouldn’t be long. The vast majority are one or two paragraphs. The first graph always explains what we did, and why we did it. The next one (or two, if needed) briefly describe how to use the feature. These graphs are rarely more than three sentences long.

The first graph translates roughly to what a User Story would do: “We did X so you can do Y.” If writing this first line is hard for us, it’s time to rethink a few things.

Oftentimes, our first sentence can be solid, but the explanation for how to use a feature can ramble on, or be confusing. This tells us a lot about how easy our proposed solution may be for users.

It’s well known that people have short attention spans when reading online. If something takes more than three sentences to explain, people probably won’t read it. And if a feature takes this much explanation, chances are users will have a hard time adopting it at all.

### Conclusion
It’s one thing to write user stories. It’s another to be truly accountable to users. I really enjoy writing these posts, because every time I write one, it makes me see our product with fresh eyes.
