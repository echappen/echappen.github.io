I’ve noticed junior and mid-level developers asking how to effectively make change at their workplace. After working quite a few jobs at this point, in both tech and non-tech positions, I’ve collected some scattered notes on the topic.

I’ll say up front that indeed there are toxic workplaces where leadership is hostile to any reasonable talk around change. These are bad situations where the only solution is to leave. It’s not worth your time or effort to try and change a culture that doesn’t want to be changed.

But for every one of these workplaces, there’s a workplace that genuinely wants change, where leadership is willing to listen, but there’s too much pressing work for anyone to put in the time to make change happen. My advice applies to places like this.

### 1.

We tend to think that bigger changes are better ones. The most common mistake I see is when people propose too large of a change. Larger changes usually take more time to implement, have greater business implications, and require more coordination between people and departments. It may not be your job to consider these kinds of things, but these are the exact things that companies consider when deciding to make a change.

Smaller changes are more likely to succeed. With small changes, there’s usually less at stake and less work needed to make the change happen. But they can have outsized impact!

People are more likely to get on board with change when there’s a momentum of success. What’s the biggest impact you can get from the smallest tweak? If people see real, positive impact from a “small” change, they’re more likely to have your back and help you with bigger ones.

### 2.

It’s not enough to propose change solely out of frustration for the current way of doing things. There’s no guarantee that your proposal will solve your current problems.

Make sure you do a detailed cost-benefit analysis for the change you’re proposing. This analysis is required for leadership to consider your changes, and if you’re not willing to put in the time to do it, no one else will be either.

### 3.

There are times when you shouldn’t propose a change unless you’re the one willing to do the work to make that change happen. Try personally prototyping the change you want to propose. This will help you work out a lot of kinks in your proposal. Meetings are much more fruitful if you can show something, instead of only talking about things in the abstract.

For instance, let’s say you’re proposing that your team do more integration testing. Try implementing an integration test on a small, self-contained flow of an existing app where you believe you can get the most benefit. This exercise will help you figure out exactly how much time it took you to write the test, and if that time was really worth it. (For the record, I usually think testing is worth it, but this is a contrived example).

### 4.

Proposing changes at work is a lot like doing a business pitch: correctly identify the problem, have a clear solution, and define straightforward metrics for measuring success. You are trying to convince people. Do these people feel your same pain-points? Will they care about your problem? Do they think your solution is doable? Why should they say yes to your plan?

### 5.

We are all biased toward our own opinions. When you receive pushback on a proposal, try not to take it too personally. There may have been legitimate aspects that you didn’t consider, or it’s just not the right time for the business to make that change. Or maybe you didn’t realize how a change would affect other employees or customers.

There have been times when I’ve proposed changes and when I got pushback, I got the impression the company was change-resistant. In retrospect, I realize I was not fully considering these factors, and I was being unfair. Try to see the situation from the perspective of your manager, the leader of the company, your coworkers, your customers, etc.

What’s worked to create change at your company? What didn’t work so well? Let me know!
