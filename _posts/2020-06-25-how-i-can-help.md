When I was starting my career as a software developer, I benefitted enormously from tactical mentors, career advisors and a tight-knit community of Dev Bootcamp Chicago graduates. Starting out in this industry can be lonely, rudderless, and frustrating, and so I want to help people who may be experiencing these things.

I think it’s good to be explicit about ways in which I’m willing and not willing to give help, so I have lists for each below.

In writing these lists, I was guided a lot by [Will Larson’s post on mentoring from privilege](https://lethain.com/mentoring-from-privilege/){:target="_blank"}, specifically his points on how to mentor without doing more harm than good. To paraphrase his points, I will try to:

1. Not give advice on things I don’t have direct experience with
2. Not generalize my experiences
3. Be explicit about when my privilege has helped me, and how my advice may not be applicable to others with different circumstances

In order to do this, I should be open about my background. In some ways, I’m similar to other people from underrepresented groups in tech. I’m a woman. I’m a career-switcher. I do not have a Computer Science degree. I’m a bootcamp graduate. I grew up in a rural part of the country with little access to tech opportunities.

But I’m also quite privileged in ways that are very typical of the tech industry. I’m white, straight, cisgendered and do not have a disability. I have a degree from a well-known university. I had a comfortable middle class upbringing that allowed me to graduate from college debt-free.
If you think my advice may be valuable to you, please reach out to me at elenichappen[at]gmail.com.

### I’m happy to help with:

- **job interview practice**: I’ve been responsible for hiring apprentices and junior-level devs, so I’m best equipped to help with those types of positions. I’m also happy to talk through salary negotiation strategies, although I don’t consider myself a real expert in that area (but can point you to other resources).
- **code review**: I can help review code for your public repos, side projects, or personal learning exercises. While I won’t review coding challenges for jobs before they’re submitted, if you want feedback on challenges after the fact, I can do that.
- resume review
- proofreading blog posts
- doing run-throughs of your tech talk
- answering questions about topics I know about

### Things I know best:

- Ruby on Rails, React.js
- user-facing web apps
- single-page apps
- building API’s
- relational database modeling
- developing apprenticeship roadmaps
- strategies for teaching yourself programming / computer science

### Unfortunately I would not be very helpful with:

- getting hired at big companies (I’ve only worked for startups with < 20 people)
- getting hired at my company (but I can answer any questions on our interview process)
- answering questions on topics I don’t know about
- connecting with strangers on LinkedIn or social media

I prefer having my LinkedIn network accurately represent my actual network. This is so when people ask me for referrals, I genuinely know the people they’re asking about. To that end, I generally don’t accept connection requests from people I haven’t met in person, or haven’t talked to extensively through email.

My dream is to see technology be built by the people it serves, and technology serves everyone. This is why I’m especially intent on helping people from underrepresented groups in tech.

These lists are incomplete and may change over time. For anything that isn’t covered here, feel free to inquire through email.
