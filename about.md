I'm originally from Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, but now live in Chicago. I don't read enough fiction and I have a serious cookbook problem. If I could have one superpower, it would be to speak any language fluently. I think software is more about people than things.

I'm always eager to connect with others who share my interests â€” find me on social media or by email.
