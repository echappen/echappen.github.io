Not a New Year's Resolution per se, but I was inspired by [this post](https://cate.blog/2021/01/04/12-days-of-creativity/){:target="_blank"} and I decided with a friend to do one creative thing a day for 15 days.

Guidelines were:
- Create one thing a day for 15 days straight.
- Creation in the most basic sense: just something that exists that didn't before.
- When sharing work with others, comments on creations are less judgement/critique and more straight observation. The point wasn't to do something well, just to do it.

My creative things were mostly short poems and playing around with my partner's digital camera. My friend mostly did watercolors. I think the insights I gained from the experience are better than the stuff I actually created. This is what I learned along the way:

I learned that having a timebox can be a good thing. Otherwise I tend to endlessly fuss over minor tweaks. Some of my strongest pieces were ones I quickly jotted down, and after cycling through rounds of edits realized that the first version was the best.

I learned that I need to give my brain a break in order to be creative. After a full day's work, I need to take a walk, move my body, do something sensory instead of intellectual. Reading a book isn't sensory enough. Browsing the internet definitely isn't sensory enough. Not only is this generally good for my mental health, it's a necessary step in the creative process.

I realize that what little creative energy I have tends to be spent on other people's endeavors (doing favors, joining committees, etc). It should be ok to be a bit more selfish about wanting to save some creative energies for oneself.

When I'm busy or tired, creativity is the first thing to drop. I could drop things like exercising, doing the dishes, other routines. If I want to keep it a habit, creativity needs to be prioritized. In doing this, I need to accept that other things may not get done, and that's okay.

I also need to accept that I'm probably not going to make my best work during the work week. But even fifteen minutes of gently pushing though end-of-day fatigue, when all I want to do is watch some Netflix, keeps the flame lit for the days when I have more time and energy.

I realized I'm affected by the act of creating itself. I've typically thought of creativity in terms of results (what have I made?). Instead I need to think of it more asâ€”what does making do to me?

For one, it subtly changes the way I think about everything else. I'm more creative in general, even in mundane chores like reoganizing my kitchen cabinets. I'm less judgmental and more curious. I'm less attached to social media. I can better recognize my mental threads and patterns: how I've been feeling, what I've been focusing on, what's kept my interest over time. I recognize that my anxiety around production is rooted in Neoliberal/Capitalist thinking and Productivity Culture. If I end up with more of a creative state of mind than actual artwork, that's an end in itself.

These insights are probably obvious to artists and people who are used to making things. But they were a good reminder to me, as someone who's taken a decade-long hiatus from serious artmaking. I'm now wondering how I can keep this up.
