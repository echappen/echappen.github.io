## Hi, I'm Eleni and I build software.

I'm a web developer working mainly in Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, and React.js.

Things I like:
- Meaningful products
- Being useful
- Working with kind and driven people
- Clear problems to solve

I'm originally from Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, but now live in Chicago. I don't read enough fiction and I have a serious cookbook problem. If I could have one superpower, it would be to speak any language fluently. I think software is more about people than things.

I'm always eager to connect with others who share my interests. Find me on social media or by email.
